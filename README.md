## Description
An automated README.md generator that uses the Inquirer NPM, File System (FS), and Node.js to automatically create README markdown files. 

## Installation
The README generator requires installation of Node.js.  Users must also have access to a IDE such as Visual Studio Code with access to the terminal or access to GitBash/Command Line Interface to run Node.  Inquirer npm must also be installed.

## Usage

To use the README generator run: "Node index.js" in the terminal, and answer the prompts.  After the prompts are answered, open the new README.md created in the current working directory, and preview the README (hit CTRL + Shift + V to preview in Visual Studio Code).
